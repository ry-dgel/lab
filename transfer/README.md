Module for handling and simulating transfer functions.

CompFun class handles discrete data, whereas AnCompFun uses analytical functions.

Includes method for generating CompFun objects from Zurich lockin data.

Builtin operators defined between CompFuns and AnCompFuns. Some might be missing...

Makes nice plots of these as well.

At some point, will calculated gain and phase margins, but currently not working.

See jupyter notebook for examples.
